# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Overview

This repository contains a Rock-Paper-Scissors game built with JavaScript, inspired by a tutorial video on YouTube. While the core functionality and logic were derived from the video, the overall design and implementation have been customized and developed by me.

## Inspiration

The primary inspiration for this project came from a YouTube tutorial by <b>SuperSimpleDev</b> titled “JavaScript Tutorial Full Course - Beginner to Pro (2024)” (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerdGm-ehJQ&t=24793s). The video provided a foundation for the game’s functionality, but I have made significant modifications to the design and code to create a unique version of the game.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer.
- **Custom Design:** Unique visual and user interface design.
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of wins, losses, and ties.

## How to Play

1. Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The computer will make its choice, and the result will be displayed.
3. Also, you can reset the scores.
